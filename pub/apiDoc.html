          <h4 style="font-weight: lighter; margin-top:-10px;"> The Time Archive library has 3 types of objects that can be created.<br />
 Each object corresponds to a type of timeline that a user can make.  <br />  Each type of Time Archive object requires a location parameter for their constructor.
 <br /> The location parameter refers to where the user wishes to add the newly made timeline.  <br />  If a location
 is not specified then the newly created Time Archive object is added to the body of an HTML file. 
            </h4>
            <h4 style=" margin-top:-10px;text-decoration: underline dotted 1px brown;" >The 'PopUpTimeline' Object</h4>
            <h4 style="font-weight: lighter; margin-top:-10px;"> In addition to a location parameter, the 'PopUpTimeline'
also has a timeline style parameter. The timeline style parameter indicates which type of 'PopUpTimeline' style the user desires.
The possible 'PopUpTimeline' styles are regular and soft. The regular style has rectangular popups that can  <br> be previewed if a user hovers over the popup's respective date on 
the timeline. The regular style also allows the user to close a selected popup via   <br>an 'X' located on the selected popup. The soft style doesn't have the preview
option that the regular style has, but it has buttons on the timeline that  <br> can be clicked to open a popup. When a button's date is clicked, the button's color changes, indicating that its been selected 
and the respective  <br> popup opens up. Unlike the regular style popup, the soft style popups can 
be closed by clicking away from the activated popup. If a timeline style is not specified in the 'PopUpTimeline' constructor then the timeline style is set to 'regular'.<br> <br> A 'PopUpTimeline' objected can be created like this: </h4>
            <p style="margin-top:-10px"><pre><code style="border: dotted 1px grey; padding:5px ;">const historyofChocolate = new PopUpTimeline("#pop", "regular");</code></pre></p>
            <h4 style=" text-decoration: underline dotted 1px brown;" >The 'SlideShowTimeLine' Object</h4>
            <h4 style="font-weight: lighter; margin-top:-10px;"> Like the 'PopUpTimeline', the 'SlideShowTimeLine' also takes in a style parameter upon initialization. The possible timeline styles for the 'SlideShowTimeLine' are 'gallery' and 'regular'. The 'gallery' style has a slide for the timeline's title. The slide navigation buttons for this style are also on the left and right of the slide display. Unlike the 'gallery' style, the 'regular' style displays the timeline's title above the slide view. Also, the 'regular' style has the slide navigation buttons below the slide view.  If a timeline style is not specified in the 'SlideShowTimeLine' constructor then the timeline style is set to 'regular'.<br> <br> A 'SlideShowTimeLine' objected can be created like this: </h4>
            <p><pre><code style="border: dotted 1px grey; padding:5px ;">const katyPerryDiscography = new SlideShowTimeLine("#slide", "gallery");</code></pre></p>
            <h4 style="text-decoration: underline dotted 1px brown;" >The 'StandardTimeLine' Object</h4>
            <h4 style="font-weight: lighter; margin-top:-10px;">Unlike the 'PopUpTimeline' and 'SlideShowTimeLine' objects, the 'StandardTimeLine' doesn't have a timeline style parameter.<br> It only has a location parameter. <br> <br> A 'StandardTimeLine' objected can be created like this: </h4>
            <p><pre><code style="border: dotted 1px grey; padding:5px ;">const Castlevania = new StandardTimeLine("#standardEx");</code></pre></p>
